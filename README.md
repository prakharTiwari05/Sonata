Welcome to Sonata, the aesthetic and soothing solution to your favorite Spotify playlists. Listen to your favorite songs and artists by logging in to your Spotify account and enjoying music within a customized web player with a minimilastic build. Test your music taste out by putting your knowledge to the front in the Guessing game feature. 

## Library
Welcome to the home screen where you are granted with direct access to your saved playlists. Each playlist is displayed with a main cover picture, along with the name and number of songs in the playlist. To begin playing, hover and click the songcard which suits your mood the best. 

## Player
The player screen provides you with the ability to play and interact with your music, along with visually appealing aesthetics that will fit your needs best. Within the player, you will be able to see more details about the chosen song such as its specific album, cover, artist(s), and release date. Choose any song within your selected playlist from the left side of the screen in the Queue, which also shows the next songs that will be played. Control your music by play/pausing, or changing to the previous/next song. 

## Guess
Interested in testing your music knowledge? Welcome to the Guess feature. The Guess feature allows you to choose from your connected playlists to begin the game. Hover and click over the playlist you would like to use as the library. Once selected, you will be prompted with 4 randomly picked songs within the selected playlist, along with information about the artist(s) who produced the piece. Click play on the player to the left and listen to 30 seconds of a randomly selected song from the playlist. One of the 4 songs on your screen will be the correct choice that matches with the audio preview that is being played. A correct guess will prompt you to the next set of songs with a congratulating message while an incorrect guess means keep guessing!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
